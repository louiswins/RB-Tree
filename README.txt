This program is written using C.

To compile, simply type `make' at the command line. This creates an executable
called `run'.

The program is created using proven information-hiding principles - the header
file RBtree_priv.h is only needed to compile the library, and you should only
include RBtree.h in your own program.

One additional feature implemented was the picture command, `P'. This creates a
Scalable Vector Graphics image. It can be converted to a more traditional image
format (such as PNG) with another program, such as ImageMagick's `convert'.
