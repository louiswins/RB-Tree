This program is written using C.

To compile, simply type `make' at the command line. This creates an executable
called `run'.

One additional feature implemented was the draw command, `T'. This creates a
Scalable Vector Graphics image. It can be converted to a more traditional image
format (such as PNG) with several programs, such as ImageMagick's `convert'.
